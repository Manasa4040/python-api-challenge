# python-api-challenge
assignment 6
This activity is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.

Part 1: WeatherPy
In this deliverable, you'll create a Python script to visualise the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. You'll use the citipy Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and your problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.
For this part, you'll use the WeatherPy.ipynb Jupyter notebook provided in the starter code ZIP file. The starter code will guide you through the process of using your Python
